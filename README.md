## Dataset Statistics
Our motivation for DUTLF-V2 is to build a versatile dataset in large scale, high diversity and broad coverage. We conduct descriptive statistics on our DUTLF-V2 in terms of the following aspects: Diversity of Salient Objects (a), Challenging Scenes (b and c), Scale of Salient Objects (e) and Distribution of Center Bias (f).
